# pgvector Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement pgvector support in the Construction Management application while maintaining compatibility with environments where pgvector is not available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Custom Data Types Utility

Updated `backend/src/utils/sequelize-datatypes.js` to:
- Create a proper class-based implementation of custom data types
- Add a robust VECTOR type that works with or without pgvector
- Handle environment variable configuration for vector similarity
- Provide proper fallback to TEXT type when pgvector is not available

### 2. Updated WorkType Model

Modified `backend/src/models/workType.js` to:
- Import and use the custom data types utility
- Use CustomDataTypes.VECTOR(384) for the name_vec field
- Remove the inline custom types definition

### 3. Enhanced WorkTypeDetectionService

Updated `backend/src/services/workTypeDetectionService.js` to:
- Add better logging for vector similarity status
- Use a safer SQL query that works with or without pgvector
- Add fallback to trigram similarity when vector similarity fails
- Pass both embedding and text for flexible similarity calculation

### 4. Added Migration for pgvector Support

Created `backend/migrations/20250530000000-add-pgvector-support.js` to:
- Check if pgvector extension is available
- Create the extension if available
- Alter the name_vec column to vector type if possible
- Create an index for efficient vector similarity search
- Provide fallback to TEXT type if pgvector is not available

### 5. Added pgvector Installation Script

Created `database/init/02-install-pgvector.sh` to:
- Install build dependencies in the PostgreSQL container
- Clone and build pgvector from source
- Install the extension in PostgreSQL
- Create the extension in the database

### 6. Updated Docker Configuration

Modified `docker-compose.yml` to:
- Include the pgvector installation script in the database container
- Enable vector similarity by default
- Update the initialization script order

### 7. Added Embedding Generation Script

Created `backend/scripts/generate-work-type-embeddings.js` to:
- Find work types without embeddings
- Generate embeddings using the DeepSeek service
- Update the work types with the embeddings
- Provide logging and error handling

### 8. Added Documentation

Created `docs/pgvector-setup.md` to:
- Explain how to set up pgvector
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Explain how to test vector similarity
- Discuss performance considerations

## Implementation Steps

To implement these changes:

1. **Update the code**:
   - Replace `backend/src/utils/sequelize-datatypes.js`
   - Update `backend/src/models/workType.js`
   - Update `backend/src/services/workTypeDetectionService.js`
   - Add the new migration file
   - Add the pgvector installation script
   - Update `docker-compose.yml`
   - Add the embedding generation script
   - Add the documentation files

2. **Restart the application**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the containers
   docker-compose down
   
   # Start the containers with the updated configuration
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   # Run the migration to set up the vector column and index
   docker-compose exec backend npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

4. **Generate embeddings**:
   ```bash
   # Generate embeddings for existing work types
   docker-compose exec backend node scripts/generate-work-type-embeddings.js
   ```

5. **Verify the implementation**:
   - Check the logs for any errors
   - Test the work type detection functionality
   - Verify that vector similarity search is working

## Configuration Options

The implementation can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `ENABLE_VECTOR_SIMILARITY`: Set to `true` to enable vector similarity, `false` to use only trigram similarity
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: API key for the DeepSeek service used to generate embeddings

## Fallback Mechanism

The implementation includes a robust fallback mechanism:

1. If pgvector is not available, the application will use trigram similarity only
2. If vector similarity is disabled, the application will use trigram similarity only
3. If vector similarity fails, the application will fall back to trigram similarity
4. The SQL query is designed to work with both vector and text columns

This ensures that the application will work in all environments, with or without pgvector.
