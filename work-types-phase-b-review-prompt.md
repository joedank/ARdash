# Prompt for Code Implementation Review with Archive

## Initial Setup Instructions

I've prepared a compressed archive containing all the files we've modified for the Phase B implementation of the Work Types Knowledge Base. Please extract both archives to examine our implementation:

```bash
# First extract the main project
tar -xzf management.tar.gz
cd management

# Then extract our implementation files for easier review
tar -xzf work-types-phase-b-implementation.tar.gz
```

The `work-types-phase-b-implementation.tar.gz` archive contains all the files we've modified, organized in the same directory structure as the main project. This should make it easier to focus on just the changes we've made.

## Files to Review

We've implemented Phase B of the Work Types Knowledge Base, which adds cost, material, and safety data management capabilities with proper security controls. Please review the following files:

### Backend Files

1. **backend/migrations/20250428-add-estimator-manager-role.js**
   - Migration to add the 'estimator_manager' role to the User model's role enum
   - Enables role-based access control for work type management

2. **backend/src/models/User.js**
   - Updated to include the 'estimator_manager' role in the role enum
   - Check lines 62-65 for the role definition

3. **backend/src/middleware/role.middleware.js**
   - Added isEstimatorManagerOrAdmin middleware to check for appropriate roles
   - Ensures only admin or estimator_manager roles can access sensitive routes
   - Check lines 26-47 for the new middleware

4. **backend/src/routes/workTypes.routes.js**
   - Updated to use the isEstimatorManagerOrAdmin middleware for protected routes
   - Applied to cost, material, and tag management endpoints
   - Check lines 7-8 for imports and lines 87, 101, 108, 122 for middleware usage

5. **backend/scripts/import-work-type-costs.js**
   - Script to backfill cost history for existing work types
   - Creates history records for work types with cost data but no history

6. **backend/tests/unit/models/workType.test.js**
   - Unit tests for the WorkType model validation
   - Tests validation rules for cost fields and required fields

7. **backend/docs/work-types-api.md**
   - API documentation for the Work Types endpoints
   - Details all available endpoints, parameters, and responses

8. **backend/docs/work-types-phase-b.md**
   - Documentation of the Phase B implementation
   - Describes the features, database schema, API endpoints, and security model

### Frontend Files

1. **frontend/src/store/auth.js**
   - Updated to add isEstimatorManager and canManageWorkTypes computed properties
   - Check lines 16-17 for the new getters and lines 214-215 for their export

2. **frontend/src/views/work-types/WorkTypeDetail.vue**
   - Updated to check for appropriate roles before showing edit buttons
   - Added CostHistoryTab component to display cost history
   - Check lines 316-329 for auth store usage and lines 44, 182 for conditional buttons

3. **frontend/src/components/work-types/MaterialsTab.vue**
   - Updated to check for appropriate roles before showing edit buttons
   - Added toast notifications for user actions
   - Check lines 304, 330-333 for auth store usage and lines 68, 75, 93, 120 for conditional buttons

4. **frontend/src/components/work-types/CostHistoryTab.vue**
   - New component to display cost history for a work type
   - Includes filtering by region and formatted display of cost data

5. **frontend/src/services/api.service.js**
   - Added convertRequestToSnakeCase helper function
   - Updated request interceptor to automatically convert request bodies
   - Check lines 24-40 for the helper function and lines 63-65 for its usage

6. **frontend/cypress/e2e/work-types/work-type-details.cy.js**
   - Cypress test for the Work Types UI
   - Tests all aspects of the work type detail view, including cost editing, materials, and history

## Review Criteria

Please evaluate our implementation based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Do the implemented features work as expected?
2. **Security**: Is the role-based access control properly implemented?
3. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, maintainable, and following best practices?
4. **Error Handling**: Are errors properly handled throughout the implementation?
5. **Testing**: Are the tests comprehensive and do they cover the key functionality?
6. **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear, complete, and accurate?

Please provide feedback on any issues, potential improvements, or areas that need further attention.
