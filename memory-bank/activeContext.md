## Previous Focus: Web Deployment Configuration

We've configured the application to be accessible via the web through Nginx Proxy Manager while keeping it in development mode. This allows for testing and using the application externally without switching to production mode.

**Current Stage: Web Access Configuration [Completed]**

1. **Frontend Configuration:**
   * **Vite Proxy Settings:**
     * Added `/api` proxy in `vite.config.js` to forward API requests to the backend
     * Enhanced `/uploads` proxy configuration for consistency
     * Set `host: '0.0.0.0'` to allow external network access to the dev server
     * Added `allowedHosts: ['job.806040.xyz', 'localhost']` to explicitly permit domains

   * **API Service Adaptation:**
     * Updated `api.service.js` to detect the environment automatically
     * Implemented conditional baseURL: uses relative `/api` when accessed via domain
     * Added `withCredentials: true` for proper cookie handling across domains

2. **Backend CORS Configuration:**
   * **Enhanced Security:**
     * Added domain (https://job.806040.xyz and http://job.806040.xyz) to allowed origins
     * Improved uploads directory access with explicit origin checking
     * Replaced wildcard CORS with specific origin allowlisting

3. **Nginx Proxy Manager Integration:**
   * **External Hosting Configuration:**
     * Domain: job.806040.xyz with SSL enabled
     * WebSocket support enabled for hot module replacement
     * Proxy forwards to Vite development server on port 5173
   * **Security Measures:**
     * SSL certificates configured for secure HTTPS connections
     * HTTP/2 support enabled for improved performance

4. **Technical Learnings:**
   * Vite development server can be exposed to the web with proper proxy configuration
   * Environment detection allows for conditional API endpoints without code changes
   * CORS must be explicitly configured for cross-domain access to work properly
   * WebSocket support is essential for maintaining development features like HMR

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Test login functionality through the proxy to ensure authentication works
2. Verify file uploads are working correctly when accessed via the domain
3. Monitor application performance when accessed through Nginx Proxy Manager
4. Test LLM estimate generation through the proxied connection

## Previous Focus: User Creation Form - Field Mismatch Resolution

We've resolved an important issue with the user creation form where there was a mismatch between frontend form fields and backend database requirements.

**Current Stage: Form Field and Error Handling Fix [Completed]**

1. **Backend-Frontend Field Mismatch Resolution:**
   * **Problem Identified:**
     * User creation was failing with "notNull Violation: User.username cannot be null"
     * Form collected 'name' but backend required 'username' field
     * Backend controller attempted to convert 'name' into firstName/lastName but didn't set username

   * **Solution Implemented:**
     * Added explicit username field to the form in UserSettings.vue
     * Updated userForm data structure to include username property
     * Enhanced form validation to verify username is provided
     * Modified validation to show detailed, field-specific error messages

2. **Form Error Display Enhancement:**
   * **UI Improvements:**
     * Changed `:error` property to functional `:state="error ? 'error' : ''"` property for all inputs
     * Added helperText to display specific error messages under each field
     * Implemented more descriptive error alerts that list all fields with issues
     * Added visual indicators (red borders) to clearly mark problematic fields

3. **Technical Learnings:**
   * Form fields must explicitly match the database model requirements
   * Visual feedback is critical for helping users identify validation issues
   * Consistent error handling patterns improve usability across the application
   * Descriptive error messages are better than generic ones for user experience

     * Fixed validation for the new measurement items structure in `ProjectInspection.js`
     * Added support for array-based measurements validation while maintaining backward compatibility
     * Prevented the "Measurements must include dimensions" error

2. **UI Layout Enhancements:**
   * **Header and Action Buttons:**
     * Changed header and action bar from sticky to static positioning
     * Removed unnecessary bottom padding from the main container
     * Placed action buttons after the content for better flow

   * **Project Workflow Improvements:**
     * Modified "Mark Complete" button to only appear for active jobs
     * Enforced proper progression: Assessment → Convert to Job → Mark Complete

   * **Mobile-Friendly Materials UI:**
     * Redesigned materials section with a vertical stacked layout on mobile
     * Made material name field full width for better visibility
     * Used equal-width quantity and unit fields with flex layout

## Previous Focus: Assessment Data Integration into LLM Estimate Generator

We have successfully implemented a new feature that allows users to import assessment data directly into the LLM estimate generator. This integration enhances the accuracy of estimates by leveraging existing project assessment information.

**Current Stage: Assessment Data Import Feature [Completed]**

1. **Key Implementation Details:**
   * **Backend:**
     * Added new endpoint `/api/estimates/llm/assessment/:projectId` to fetch assessment data
     * Enhanced the LLM service to format assessment data and incorporate it into the analysis prompt
     * Modified the existing analysis endpoint to accept and use assessment data

   * **Frontend:**
     * Added a dropdown selector for assessment projects in `LLMEstimateInput.vue`
     * Implemented UI to display imported assessment data and allow removal if needed
     * Added visual indicators when assessment data is incorporated into analysis
     * Fixed component reference issue (changed `ServiceMatchReview` to `ProductMatchReview`)

2. **User Workflow:**
   * User selects an assessment project from the dropdown
   * System fetches detailed assessment data (inspections, measurements, materials)
   * User enters a project description and initiates analysis
   * LLM incorporates both description and assessment data into its analysis
   * System shows visual confirmation when assessment data is used
   * Analysis results in fewer clarifying questions when data is available from assessment

3. **Technical Learnings:**
   * Proper formulation of LLM prompts to use contextual data effectively
   * Dynamic UI updates based on data availability
   * Project selection pattern with dropdown and data fetching
   * Component naming consistency importance
   * Need to restart backend server when adding new routes

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Monitor usage of the assessment data import feature
2. Consider additional enhancements, such as:
   * Automatic prefilling of the description field based on assessment scope
   * More detailed breakdown of which data points came from the assessment
   * Direct creation of estimates from assessments via a dedicated workflow

**Current Stage: Service-Only Focus Implementation [Completed]**

1.  **Service-Only Focus Implementation:**
    *   **Backend:** Modified `llmEstimateService.js` to focus exclusively on services:
        * Updated all LLM prompts to specifically guide the model toward repair services
        * Modified `matchProductsToLineItems` to only search for items with `type: 'service'`
        * Changed `createNewProducts` to always create items with `type: 'service'`
    *   **Frontend:** Updated UI to reflect service-only focus:
        * Renamed component headings from "Product Matching" to "Service Matching"
        * Added clear messaging that the tool focuses on repair services only
        * Changed "Create New Product" buttons to "Create New Service"
        * Updated form labels accordingly ("Service Name", "Service Description")

2.  **Recent Fixes (Workflow & UI):**
    *   **Estimate Creation Prefill:**
        *   Modified `LLMEstimateInput.vue` (`handleMatchingFinished`) to use `router.push` for navigation to `/invoicing/create-estimate`.
        *   Passed finalized line items as an encoded JSON string in the `items` query parameter.
        *   Updated `CreateEstimate.vue` (`onMounted`) to parse the `items` query parameter and prefill the line items editor.
    *   **Modal Persistence & Layout:**
        *   Removed the `@click` handler from the background overlay in the generator modal (`EstimatesList.vue`) to prevent closing on background click.
        *   Increased the `z-index` of the generator modal (`EstimatesList.vue`) and the `ProductMatchReview.vue` component to `z-50` to ensure they appear above the main navigation.
        *   Adjusted vertical alignment and added top padding/margin (`pt-16` or `mt-16`) to the generator modal (`EstimatesList.vue`), `LLMEstimateInput.vue`, and `ProductMatchReview.vue` to prevent overlap with the navigation bar.
    *   **Modal Closing:**
        *   Added a `close` event emission in `LLMEstimateInput.vue` after navigating to the estimate creation page.
        *   Updated `EstimatesList.vue` to listen for the `close` event and hide the generator modal (`showGeneratorModal = false`).

**Key Technical Learnings:**
1.  Using `router.push` is necessary for proper SPA navigation instead of `window.location.href`.
2.  Passing complex data (like line items) via query parameters requires encoding (e.g., `encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(...))`) and decoding/parsing on the receiving end.
3.  Modal persistence requires removing background click handlers.
4.  Controlling stacking order requires careful management of `z-index` and CSS positioning (`relative`, `fixed`).
5.  Component communication (parent listening for child events) is crucial for managing modal visibility across components.

We implemented a new feature to generate estimates using an LLM (DeepSeek). We completed both the initial analysis phase and the clarification handling phase with performance enhancements. We then implemented product matching to connect the LLM-generated line items with our actual product catalog.

**Stage: Product Matching Integration [Completed]**

1.  **Previous Completion (Clarification Handling):**
    *   **Frontend:** Successfully implemented dynamic input fields for measurements and questions in `LLMEstimateInput.vue`.
    *   **Backend:** Implemented the `handleClarifications` method in `LLMEstimateService`.
    *   **LLM Integration:** Successfully switched from 'deepseek-reasoner' to 'deepseek-chat' model for better reliability.
    *   **API Optimization:** Increased timeout limits to 6 minutes in the frontend service.
    *   **UX Improvements:** Added loading indicators with contextual messages.

2.  **Product Matching Implementation:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Implemented `matchProductsToLineItems` in `llmEstimateService.js` using string similarity and unit matching.
        *   Implemented `/api/estimates/llm/match-products` endpoint in `estimates.controller.js`.
        *   Implemented `createProductsFromLineItems` in `llmEstimateService.js`.
        *   Implemented `/api/estimates/llm/create-products` endpoint in `estimates.controller.js`.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Created `ProductMatchReview.vue` component for reviewing matches, selecting existing products, or defining new ones.
        *   Integrated `ProductMatchReview.vue` into the `LLMEstimateInput.vue` workflow.
        *   Added logic to call `createProductsFromLineItems` if new products are defined.
        *   Modified `handleMatchingFinished` in `LLMEstimateInput.vue` to prepare finalized line items (with existing or newly created product info).

## Previous Focus: Product Catalog and Unit-Based Pricing Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive product catalog management system with unit-based pricing to address issues with the estimate section's product selection capabilities.

1.  **Product Catalog Error Resolution:**
    *   **Problem:** Error in the estimate section when trying to access products
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing 'type' column in products table, causing a database error
    *   **Database Fix:** Added the missing 'type' column as ENUM('product', 'service')
    *   **Sample Data:** Added initial set of products and services with pricing

2.  **Unit-Based Pricing Implementation:**
    *   **Features:**
        *   Added 'unit' field to products table (sq ft, ln ft, each, etc.)
        *   Default value of 'each' for existing products
        *   Support for custom unit types
        *   Clear unit display in product listings

3.  **Admin Interface Integration:**
    *   Added ProductCatalogManager.vue component
    *   Integrated into admin settings with dedicated tab
    *   Full CRUD operations for products/services
    *   Search and filtering capabilities
    *   Type-specific styling (Products vs Services)
