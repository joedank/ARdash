# Project Brief: Construction Management Web Application

## Overview
This project is a construction management web application. The primary focus is on robust, accurate estimate generation for construction and repair projects, seamless UI/UX for estimate workflows, and ensuring compatibility across both new and legacy estimate generation interfaces. All estimate-related backend services and frontend components must be compatible, reliable, and free of critical bugs.

## Core Requirements
1. Assessment-to-estimate workflow with AI-assisted conversion
2. Client and project management capabilities
3. Measurement tracking with support for area, linear, and quantity-based calculations
4. Photo documentation for property conditions
5. Estimate generation, review, and finalization
6. Invoice creation and management
7. User authentication and role-based access
8. Responsive design for field use on various devices

## Goals
- Streamline the construction assessment and estimation process
- Reduce manual effort through AI-assisted estimate generation
- Provide accurate measurements with appropriate calculation methods
- Maintain comprehensive project documentation
- Enable efficient client communication and project tracking
- Support various measurement types for different construction elements
- Ensure data consistency throughout the project lifecycle

## Scope
- Complete assessment workflow with condition documentation
- Flexible measurement system supporting area, linear, and quantity calculations
- AI-powered conversion from assessment to structured estimate
- Project tracking from assessment to completion
- Client management and communication
- Photo documentation and organization
- Estimate and invoice generation

## Success Criteria
- Seamless workflow from assessment to estimate to project to invoice
- Accurate measurement calculations based on type (area, linear, quantity)
- Consistent data preservation throughout the project lifecycle
- Intuitive user interface for field use
- Reliable estimate generation from assessment data
- Comprehensive project documentation capabilities
- Efficient client and project management
