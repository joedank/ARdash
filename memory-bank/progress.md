[2025-05-02 16:45] - **Working on Assessment to Estimate Conversion Project ID Issue**

**Issues Identified:**

1. Assessment to estimate conversion failing with "Project ID is required" error:
   - When selecting an assessment in the assessment-to-estimate view and trying to generate an estimate
   - Backend API returning 400 Bad Request with "Project ID is required" message
   - Console showing error in the estimate generation process
   - Initial API endpoint for loading assessment data returning 404 Not Found

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. Multiple issues identified:
   - The frontend is not properly extracting and passing the project ID to the backend
   - The backend controller expects a specific `projectId` parameter but it's not being sent
   - The API endpoint URL for loading assessment data is incorrect (`/api/api/assessment/for-project/${projectId}` instead of `/estimates/llm/assessment/${projectId}`)
   - Double `/api/api/` prefix in the URL due to the `apiService` automatically prepending `/api`

**Solution Implementation In Progress:**

1. Enhanced project ID extraction in `standardized-estimates.service.js`:
   - Added more robust extraction logic to find project ID in different locations within the assessment object
   - Added detailed logging to trace the assessment object structure and extraction process
   - Added fallback to extract project ID from URL if not found in assessment object

2. Updated backend controller with better error handling:
   - Enhanced `generateEstimateFromAssessment` controller to provide more detailed error messages
   - Added UUID validation to ensure project ID is in the correct format
   - Added more detailed logging of request body and assessment structure

3. Updated `EstimateFromAssessment.vue` component:
   - Explicitly adding project ID to assessment object before sending to backend
   - Added more detailed error handling and logging

**Key Learnings:**

- Project ID extraction needs to be robust and handle multiple possible data structures
- Detailed logging is essential for diagnosing complex data flow issues
- The `apiService` in this application prepends `/api` to all requests, which can lead to duplicate paths
- API endpoint URLs must be carefully maintained, especially after backend restructuring
- Frontend components should ensure critical parameters like project ID are explicitly included in requests

[2025-05-01 14:30] - **Fixed Assessment Data Display Issue in Estimate Conversion Workflow**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**

1. Assessment data not displaying after selection in the assessment-to-estimate conversion workflow:
   - When selecting an assessment in the assessment-to-estimate view, the data was not displayed
   - The console showed successful data loading but the UI still showed "No assessment data loaded"
   - The API endpoint URL was incorrect, causing a 404 error

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. Two separate issues were identified:
   - The frontend was using the wrong API endpoint URL (`/api/assessment/for-project/${projectId}` instead of `/estimates/llm/assessment/${projectId}`)
   - The frontend components were looking for `formattedMarkdown` property but the backend was returning `formattedData`

**Solution Implemented:**

1. Fixed the API endpoint URL in `standardized-estimates.service.js`:
   - Changed from `/api/assessment/for-project/${projectId}` to `/estimates/llm/assessment/${projectId}`
   - This resolved the 404 error when trying to fetch assessment data

2. Enhanced frontend components to handle both property names:
   - Updated `AssessmentToEstimateView.vue` to check for both `formattedMarkdown` and `formattedData` properties
   - Added a computed property `normalizedAssessment` that ensures the assessment data has a `formattedMarkdown` property
   - Modified `AssessmentMarkdownPanel.vue` to use either property with a fallback mechanism
   - Updated `EstimateFromAssessment.vue` to check for both properties when determining if assessment data is available

**Key Learnings:**

- API endpoint URLs must be carefully maintained, especially after backend restructuring
- Frontend components should be flexible in handling different property names with fallback mechanisms
- The `apiService` in this application prepends `/api` to all requests, which can lead to duplicate paths if not careful
- Computed properties can be used to normalize data structures before passing to child components
- Console logs are valuable for debugging but may not reveal all issues, especially property name mismatches

[2025-04-29 10:15] - **Enhanced Community UI with Tooltips and Fixed WebSocket Security Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. WebSocket connection errors when accessing the application over HTTPS:
   - Error: `Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but attempted to connect to the insecure WebSocket endpoint 'ws://job.806040.xyz:5173'`
   - Error: `SecurityError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': An insecure WebSocket connection may not be initiated from a page loaded over HTTPS`
   - The application was still functional but showed errors in the console

2. Community creation UI had explanatory text on buttons that cluttered the interface:
   - "Set as Active" button included text "(requires at least one selected ad type)"
   - This made the button unnecessarily wide and text-heavy
   - The UI didn't follow the project's clean design principles

3. BaseButton component had invalid prop validation:
   - Console warning: `Invalid prop: custom validator check failed for prop "variant"`
   - The code was using `variant="success"` but this wasn't a valid option in the component

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Fixed WebSocket connection issues by updating Vite configuration:
   - Changed WebSocket protocol configuration from `protocol: 'ws'` to use host-based configuration
   - Removed explicit protocol setting and let the browser determine the appropriate protocol
   - Updated both `vite.config.js` and `vite.config.docker.js` for consistency

2. Enhanced Community UI with tooltips instead of explanatory text:
   - Replaced inline text explanation with BaseTooltip component
   - Set tooltip to only appear when the button is disabled
   - Used concise tooltip text "Ad type required" instead of longer explanation
   - Made the UI cleaner and more consistent with the rest of the application

3. Fixed BaseButton prop validation issue:
   - Changed button variant from "success" to "primary" which is a valid option
   - Ensured all components use valid prop values to prevent console warnings

**Key Learnings:**
- When accessing an application over HTTPS, WebSocket connections must also use secure protocol (WSS)
- Vite's HMR configuration needs special handling for HTTPS environments
- Tooltips provide a cleaner UI solution for contextual help compared to inline text
- The BaseTooltip component is an effective way to provide information without cluttering the UI
- Always check component prop validators to ensure valid values are used
- UI should prioritize clean, concise interfaces with appropriate component selection over explanatory text

[2025-04-28 14:30] - **Fixed Community Update Issues and Made Modal Windows Persistent**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Community updates and ad type creation were showing errors when accessed over SSL:
   - Updates were actually happening in the database but errors were shown to the user
   - Error message: "Failed to update community: Failed to update community: No data returned"
   - Similar errors occurred when creating or editing ad types
   - The application was being accessed over HTTPS via a domain with SSL termination

2. Modal windows (edit community, new community, etc.) were closing when users clicked outside:
   - This could lead to accidental data loss if users unintentionally clicked outside the modal
   - Users expected modals to be persistent and only closable via the cancel button

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced response handling in community service methods:
   - Updated `updateCommunity`, `createAdType`, `updateAdType`, and `selectAdType` methods
   - Added support for different API response structures with proper fallbacks
   - Implemented detailed logging to trace API responses and data conversion
   - Added more robust error handling with detailed error messages

2. Made modal windows persistent:
   - Updated BaseModal component to make `persistent` prop default to `true`
   - Enhanced the `onBackdropClick` method to provide visual feedback when users try to click outside
   - Updated the `onEsc` method to prevent closing with the Escape key
   - Improved the shake animation to be more noticeable when users try to dismiss a persistent modal

**Key Learnings:**
- API response structures may vary, especially when accessed over SSL with proxy servers
- Service methods should handle different response structures with proper fallbacks
- Detailed logging helps identify the exact structure of API responses
- Modal windows should be persistent by default to prevent accidental data loss
- Visual feedback (shake animation) helps users understand that clicking outside won't close the modal
- The application uses bcryptjs for password hashing, which is important to note for future database-related issues

---

[2025-04-27 16:30] - **Enhanced Communities Pages with Consistent Styling and Fixed WebSocket Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Communities pages had inconsistent styling compared to the rest of the application:
   - Custom styling was used instead of the application's standard components
   - Modal dialogs used custom implementation instead of BaseModal component
   - Form fields used basic HTML inputs instead of BaseInput and BaseFormGroup components
   - No animations or transitions for improved user experience

2. WebSocket connection errors when accessing the application over HTTPS:
   - Console showed `Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but attempted to connect to the insecure WebSocket endpoint 'ws://job.806040.xyz:5173'`
   - Error: `SecurityError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': An insecure WebSocket connection may not be initiated from a page loaded over HTTPS`
   - The application was still functional but showed errors in the console

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced Communities pages with consistent styling:
   - Refactored CommunitiesListView.vue and CommunityDetailView.vue to use BaseCard components
   - Updated all modals to use BaseModal component for consistent styling and behavior
   - Implemented form fields using BaseInput, BaseTextarea, and BaseFormGroup components
   - Added transition animations for card and table row elements with fade and slide effects
   - Improved form layouts with responsive grid designs for better mobile experience
   - Enhanced hover effects for cards and interactive elements

2. Fixed WebSocket connection issues by updating Vite configuration:
   ```javascript
   // In vite.config.js
   export default defineConfig({
     // ... other config
     server: {
       // ... other server config
       hmr: {
         // Enable HMR with more robust configuration
         host: 'job.806040.xyz',
         port: 5173,
         clientPort: 443, // Use the HTTPS port when accessed via HTTPS
         protocol: 'wss', // Always use secure WebSockets
         timeout: 120000, // Increase timeout for better reliability
         overlay: true
       }
     }
   });
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- Consistent component usage across the application improves maintainability and user experience
- BaseModal, BaseInput, and other reusable components provide a more consistent UI
- When accessing an application over HTTPS, WebSocket connections must also use secure protocol (WSS)
- Vite's HMR configuration needs special handling for HTTPS environments
- Animations and transitions can significantly improve the perceived quality of the application
- Responsive grid layouts provide better experiences across different device sizes
- Nginx Proxy Manager handles SSL termination but requires proper WebSocket configuration

[2025-04-26 14:45] - **Fixed Community Detail View Data Loading Issue**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Community detail view was showing "Community data is empty or null, using default values" error:
   - Error occurred in `CommunityDetailView.vue` when trying to view a specific community
   - The community data was not being properly retrieved from the API
   - Console showed error at line 499 in the component
   - The issue was related to the camelCase/snake_case conversion similar to the main communities page

2. Root cause identified in service implementation:
   - `getCommunityById` method in `community.service.js` was expecting a specific response structure
   - The API response structure might be different after the database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Similar issue was previously fixed in the `getAllCommunities` method but not in the detail view method

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced `getCommunityById` method in `community.service.js` to handle different response structures:
   ```javascript
   async getCommunityById(id) {
     try {
       console.log(`Fetching community with ID: ${id}`);
       const response = await apiClient.get(`/communities/${id}`);

       // Debug the raw API response to see its structure
       console.log('Raw API response:', response);

       // Handle different response structures
       let communityData;
       if (response.data && response.data.data) {
         // Standard structure: { data: { data: {...} } }
         communityData = response.data.data;
       } else if (response.data) {
         // Alternative structure: { data: {...} }
         communityData = response.data;
       } else {
         // Unexpected structure
         console.error('Unexpected API response structure:', response);
         return null;
       }

       // Convert to camelCase and debug the result
       const camelCaseData = toCamelCase(communityData);
       console.log('Converted community data:', camelCaseData);

       return camelCaseData;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Error fetching community ${id}:`, error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

2. Similarly enhanced `getAdTypes` method to handle different response structures and provide better error handling:
   ```javascript
   async getAdTypes(communityId) {
     try {
       console.log(`Fetching ad types for community ID: ${communityId}`);
       const response = await apiClient.get(`/communities/${communityId}/ad-types`);

       // Handle different response structures
       let adTypesData;
       if (response.data && response.data.data) {
         adTypesData = response.data.data;
       } else if (response.data) {
         adTypesData = response.data;
       } else {
         console.error('Unexpected API response structure for ad types:', response);
         return [];
       }

       return toCamelCase(adTypesData);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Error fetching ad types for community ${communityId}:`, error);
       // Return empty array on error to prevent undefined errors
       return [];
     }
   }
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- API response structures may vary, especially after database migrations
- Service methods should handle different response structures with proper fallbacks
- Detailed logging helps identify the exact structure of API responses
- Similar fixes should be applied consistently across related methods
- Return appropriate default values (null for single objects, empty arrays for collections) when no data is found
- The same camelCase/snake_case conversion issues that affected the main communities page also affected the detail view

---

[2025-04-25 11:30] - **Fixed Vue Component Undefined Property Access in CommunityDetailView**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Vue component was throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')" errors:
   - Error occurred in `CommunityDetailView.vue` when trying to access `community.name`
   - The error happened during component rendering when API data wasn't loaded yet
   - Console showed error at line 20 in the template section
   - Additional errors occurred in various methods when accessing community properties

2. Root cause identified in component implementation:
   - `community` ref was initialized as an empty object `{}` without default properties
   - When API calls failed or before data loaded, properties were undefined
   - Template was accessing properties like `community.name` without defensive checks
   - Methods were not checking for undefined values before accessing nested properties

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced reactive data initialization with comprehensive default values:
   ```javascript
   const community = ref({
     name: '',
     address: '',
     city: '',
     state: '',
     phone: '',
     spaces: '',
     adSpecialistName: '',
     adSpecialistEmail: '',
     adSpecialistPhone: '',
     newsletterLink: '',
     generalNotes: '',
     isActive: false,
     selectedAdTypeId: null
   });
   ```

2. Improved loadCommunity method with proper error handling and data merging:
   ```javascript
   const loadCommunity = async () => {
     loading.value = true;
     error.value = null;

     try {
       const data = await communityService.getCommunityById(communityId.value);

       // Check if data exists before assigning
       if (data) {
         // Merge data with default values to ensure all properties exist
         community.value = {
           name: '',
           // ... default values
           ...data // Spread the API data over defaults
         };
       } else {
         throw new Error('Community data not found');
       }
     } catch (err) {
       console.error('Failed to load community:', err);
       error.value = 'Failed to load community. Please try again.';

       // Reset community to default values on error
       community.value = {
         name: '',
         // ... default values
       };
     } finally {
       loading.value = false;
     }
   };
   ```

3. Added defensive template rendering with optional chaining and fallbacks:
   ```html
   <h1>{{ community?.name || 'Community Details' }}</h1>
   <div class="community-status">
     <span class="status-indicator" :class="{ 'active': community?.isActive }"></span>
     <span class="status-label">{{ community?.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' }}</span>
   </div>
   ```

4. Created form preparation methods to properly initialize edit forms:
   ```javascript
   const prepareEditCommunity = () => {
     // Reset the form first
     Object.assign(editedCommunity, {
       name: '',
       // ... default values
     });

     // Copy values from the community object with fallbacks
     if (community.value) {
       Object.assign(editedCommunity, {
         name: community.value.name || '',
         // ... other properties with fallbacks
       });
     }

     showEditModal.value = true;
   };
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- Initialize reactive data with comprehensive default values for all properties used in templates
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`||`) in templates for defensive rendering
- Implement two-step form reset and population to prevent stale data issues
- Add validation in methods to check for required values before API calls
- Reset objects to default values on error to prevent cascading undefined errors
- Use Object.assign() for efficient object property updates with defaults
- Enhance utility methods like formatDate() and formatPhone() with robust error handling

[2025-04-23 14:30] - **Fixed Component Prop Validation and v-model Binding Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Vue console warnings about invalid prop types and extraneous non-props attributes:
   - `RejectAssessmentModal` component was receiving `undefined` for required `projectId` prop
   - `BaseModal` component was receiving `show` prop but expecting `modelValue` for v-model binding
   - Modal components were being rendered before data was available

2. Root causes identified in component implementation:
   - `RejectAssessmentModal` had `projectId` as a required prop with no default value
   - `ProjectDetail.vue` was passing `project?.id` which could be undefined during loading
   - `BaseModal` component used `modelValue` for v-model but was receiving `show` prop

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated `RejectAssessmentModal.vue` to make `projectId` prop optional with a default value:
   ```javascript
   projectId: {
     type: String,
     required: false,
     default: ''
   }
   ```

2. Added validation in the `confirmReject` method to check if `projectId` is valid before making API call:
   ```javascript
   if (!props.projectId) {
     handleError(new Error('Project ID is missing. Cannot reject assessment.'));
     return;
   }
   ```

3. Updated `ProjectDetail.vue` to only render the modal when project data is available:
   ```html
   <RejectAssessmentModal
     v-if="project && project.id"
     :show="showRejectModal"
     :project-id="project.id"
     @close="showRejectModal = false"
     @rejected="handleRejection"
   />
   ```

4. Fixed v-model binding in `RejectAssessmentModal.vue` to use `model-value` prop:
   ```html
   <BaseModal
     :model-value="show"
     @update:model-value="$emit('close')"
     @close="onClose"
     size="md"
     :title="'Reject Assessment'"
   >
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- Props with `required: true` should be carefully used, especially for components that might render during loading states
- Conditional rendering (`v-if`) should be used to prevent components from rendering before data is available
- When using v-model with custom components, ensure the prop name matches what the component expects (typically `modelValue`)
- Adding validation in component methods provides an additional safety layer for required data
- Vue's warning system effectively highlights potential issues that could cause runtime errors

---

[2025-04-22 16:45] - **Fixed Project Creation with Required Scheduled Date**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project creation was failing with validation errors:
   - Backend required `scheduled_date` field but frontend wasn't sending it
   - No date picker was available in the create project form
   - Console showed validation errors when trying to create a project

2. Root cause identified in form implementation:
   - `CreateProject.vue` component was only sending `clientId` and optionally `estimateId`
   - Backend model required `scheduled_date` to be non-null
   - No default value was set for scheduled date in the database

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added date picker to the project creation form:
   ```html
   <div>
     <label for="scheduledDate" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Scheduled Date</label>
     <input
       id="scheduledDate"
       v-model="scheduledDate"
       type="date"
       required
       class="mt-1 block w-full pl-3 pr-10 py-2 text-base border-gray-300 focus:outline-none focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:border-indigo-500 sm:text-sm rounded-md"
     />
   </div>
   ```

2. Added scheduledDate ref with default value of today's date:
   ```javascript
   const scheduledDate = ref(new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]);
   ```

3. Updated project creation data to include the scheduled date:
   ```javascript
   const projectData = {
     clientId: selectedClientId.value,
     scheduledDate: scheduledDate.value,
     // Add estimateId only if an estimate is selected
     ...(selectedEstimate.value ? { estimateId: selectedEstimate.value.id } : {})
   };
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- Always check backend model requirements when creating forms
- Required fields should have appropriate UI elements and default values
- Date fields should use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistent API communication
- Form validation should match backend validation requirements

---

[2025-04-15 18:45] - **Implemented 'Rejected' Status for Assessment Projects**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Assessment project workflow lacked clarity about customer decisions:
   - No way to track assessments where customers chose not to proceed
   - All non-converted assessments appeared as in-progress regardless of decision
   - No ability to filter out rejected assessments in dashboard or reports

2. Root cause identified in project status limitations:
   - Existing statuses (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `upcoming`) did not capture customer rejection
   - No dedicated UI for marking assessments as rejected with reasons
   - No dashboard section for tracking rejected assessments

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added 'rejected' status to `enum_projects_status` in PostgreSQL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TYPE enum_projects_status ADD VALUE 'rejected';
   ```

2. Added backend functionality for rejection workflow:
   - Created `rejectAssessment(projectId, rejectionReason)` method in projectService
   - Added controller endpoint for handling assessment rejection
   - Implemented GET route for fetching rejected assessments
   - Enhanced status validation to ensure status appropriateness for project type

3. Updated frontend components for rejected assessments:
   - Created RejectAssessmentModal.vue for capturing rejection reasons
   - Updated ProjectStatusBadge.vue to style the rejected status
   - Added reject button to assessment projects in ProjectDetail.vue
   - Added Rejected Assessments section to the dashboard

4. Implemented dashboard integration:
   - Added `getRejectedProjects()` method to show recently rejected assessments
   - Enhanced ProjectCard.vue to display the rejected status correctly
   - Created standardized service method for fetching rejected assessments

**Key Learnings:**
- Project statuses should capture the complete business workflow including negative outcomes
- Tracking rejections provides valuable business intelligence about conversion rates
- Status implementations should align with user mental models and business terminology
- Modal-based workflows with reason capturing improve data quality for analysis
- Creating a complete project lifecycle view improves business planning and forecasting

---

[2025-04-22 15:45] - **Implemented 'Upcoming' Project Status and Automatic Transitions**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project workflow lacked clarity between assessment phase and active in-progress work:
   - No clear way to indicate jobs scheduled for future dates
   - ProjectsView.vue had 'Upcoming Jobs' section but no data source to populate it
   - Dashboard showed future jobs as 'in_progress' causing confusion

2. Root cause identified in project state management:
   - Only three status values (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`) were insufficient
   - Projects needed a fourth state between assessment approval and active work
   - No automated mechanism to transition projects from upcoming to in-progress when scheduled date arrived

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added 'upcoming' status to `enum_projects_status` in PostgreSQL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TYPE enum_projects_status ADD VALUE 'upcoming';
   ```

2. Updated frontend components to support the new status:
   - Modified `ProjectSettings.vue` to include 'upcoming' status in dropdowns and filters
   - Updated status formatting logic and visual styling
   - Enhanced the dashboard experience with properly populated Upcoming Jobs section

3. Modified backend service implementations:
   - Updated `projectService.getUpcomingProjects()` to use status value instead of date-based logic
   - Adjusted `createProject()` to automatically set 'upcoming' status for future-dated projects
   - Updated `convertAssessmentToJob()` to set appropriate status based on scheduled date
   - Added new `updateUpcomingProjects()` method to automatically transition projects

4. Created automation for state transitions:
   - Implemented a CRON-compatible script (`update-upcoming-projects.js`)
   - Set up API endpoint (`/api/projects/update-upcoming`)
   - Created crontab template for daily execution

**Key Learnings:**
- Project states should match the actual business workflow rather than technical distinctions
- Automatic state transitions reduce manual work and prevent projects from getting "stuck" in the wrong state
- Even small database schema changes (adding an enum value) can significantly improve UX when implemented thoughtfully
- CRON automation can effectively handle time-based state changes without manual intervention

---

[2025-04-17 10:30] - **Fixed UUID Validation in Project Dashboard Routes**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project dashboard was showing UUID validation errors for routes that don't have ID parameters:
   - `GET /api/projects/current-active` returning 400 Bad Request with "Invalid UUID format for parameter 'id'"
   - Same error occurring for `/api/projects/assessments`, `/api/projects/upcoming`, and `/api/projects/recently-completed`
   - Error prevented dashboard from displaying any project data

2. Root cause identified in routes and controller implementation:
   - Routes were implicitly expecting UUID validation but were not ID-specific routes
   - Service methods weren't properly handling empty result sets and error cases
   - The routes were supposed to fetch collections of projects without needing any ID parameter

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated routes with explicit documentation noting they don't require UUID validation:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * @route   GET /api/projects/current-active
    * @desc    Get the current active job
    * @access  Private
    * @note    This route doesn't require UUID validation as it has no parameters
    */
   router.get('/current-active', authenticate, controller.getCurrentActiveJob);
   ```

2. Enhanced service methods with proper error handling and empty result handling:
   ```javascript
   async getCurrentActiveJob() {
     try {
       const activeJob = await Project.findOne({
         where: { type: 'active', status: 'in_progress' },
         include: [...],
         order: [['updated_at', 'DESC']]
       });

       // If no active job is found, return null without error
       if (!activeJob) {
         logger.info('No active job found');
         return null;
       }

       return activeJob;
     } catch (error) {
       logger.error('Error getting current active job:', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Added explicit comments in controllers clarifying these endpoints don't use URL parameters:
   ```javascript
   const getCurrentActiveJob = async (req, res, next) => {
     try {
       // This endpoint doesn't use any URL parameters, so no UUID validation needed
       const activeJob = await projectService.getCurrentActiveJob();
       // ...
     }
   };
   ```

**Key Learnings:**
- Routes without URL path parameters don't need UUID validation middleware
- Service methods should handle empty result sets with explicit null or empty array returns
- Proper error handling at the service level prevents cascading errors to the frontend
- Routes need clear documentation about parameter expectations and validation requirements
- Dashboard is now able to properly display all project categories: current active job, assessments, upcoming jobs, and recently completed projects

[2025-04-16 21:15] - **Implemented Workflow-Focused Project Dashboard**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project dashboard not optimized for small company workflow:
   - Company typically only works on one active job at a time
   - Current UI showed all projects with equal emphasis
   - Project list didn't clearly distinguish between workflow phases
   - Difficult to quickly identify the current focus

2. Implemented Workflow-Focused Dashboard pattern:
   - Created specialized backend endpoints for different project categories
   - Restructured UI with clear hierarchy focusing on current active job
   - Organized projects into logical workflow phases
   - Improved information architecture with clear section headings and descriptions

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added specialized backend service methods:
   ```javascript
   // Get the current active job (most recently updated 'in_progress' job)
   async getCurrentActiveJob() {
     const activeJob = await Project.findOne({
       where: { type: 'active', status: 'in_progress' },
       include: [...], // Relations
       order: [['updated_at', 'DESC']]
     });
     return activeJob;
   }
   ```

2. Created additional endpoints for different project categories:
   ```javascript
   // Get assessment projects
   router.get('/assessments', authenticate, controller.getAssessmentProjects);

   // Get upcoming projects
   router.get('/upcoming', authenticate, controller.getUpcomingProjects);

   // Get recently completed projects
   router.get('/recently-completed', authenticate, controller.getRecentlyCompletedProjects);
   ```

3. Reorganized dashboard UI with clear section hierarchy:
   - Current Active Job (highlighted with blue border)
   - In Assessment Phase (projects being evaluated)
   - Upcoming Jobs (scheduled for future dates)
   - Recently Completed (reference for finished work)

4. Added descriptive section headers and explanatory text

**Key Learnings:**
- UI should match the actual workflow of the company
- Specialized database queries are more efficient than frontend filtering
- Visual hierarchy should reflect business priorities
- Clear section headers with descriptions improve usability
- Independent section loading improves perceived performance
- Dashboard design should prioritize the most important information

---

[2025-04-16 00:30] - **Implemented Project Conversion Filtering and Relationship Indicators**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project management was showing duplicate entries for related projects (assessment/active job):
   - Both the assessment and its converted job were showing in the projects list
   - UI looked cluttered and confusing with duplicate data
   - Relationships between projects weren't visually clear

2. Implemented Data-Driven Conditional Display pattern:
   - Added backend filtering to show only non-converted assessments by default
   - Added frontend toggle to show/hide converted assessments when needed
   - Included relationship data in API responses (`assessment` and `convertedJob`)
   - Added visual indicators (arrow icons) to show conversion relationships

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated project service to filter based on `converted_to_job_id`:
   ```javascript
   if (filters.includeConverted !== true) {
     where.converted_to_job_id = null;
   }
   ```

2. Added relationship includes to API responses:
   ```javascript
   include: [..., {
     model: Project,
     as: 'assessment',
     required: false
   }, {
     model: Project,
     as: 'convertedJob',
     required: false
   }]
   ```

3. Added toggle UI with clear visual design:
   ```html
   <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
     <input
       type="checkbox"
       id="showConverted"
       v-model="showConvertedProjects"
     />
     <label for="showConverted">
       Show converted assessments
     </label>
   </div>
   ```

4. Added conversion indicators to project type display

**Key Learnings:**
- Data-driven filtering at the API level is more efficient than client-side filtering
- Clear visual indicators help users understand relationships
- Toggle controls give users explicit control over UI complexity
- Self-referential database relationships require special handling in includes and filters
- Including related models in API responses allows frontend to show relationship context

# Progress Log

[2025-04-15 23:45] - **Fixed Vue Component Tag Syntax and Client Display in Edit Forms**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Vue component syntax errors in ProjectSettings.vue:
   - Several form components were using incorrect tag syntax with attributes outside the opening tags
   - HTML comments inside attribute areas were causing visible text in the UI
   - `inputId` required prop was missing from BaseFormGroup component
2. Client name not displaying in project edit form:
   - ClientSelector component was expecting a complete client object but receiving just an ID
   - Data structure mismatch between the form value and component expectation

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Fixed Vue component tags:
   - Properly structured self-closing tags for components without children
   - Ensured attributes are inside the opening tags
   - Removed HTML comments from attribute areas
2. Fixed client display in edit form:
   - Added form reset before populating with new project data
   - Ensured full client object is passed to the ClientSelector component
   - Added better error handling and debug logging

**Key Learnings:**
- Vue component syntax requires careful attention to tag structure and attribute placement
- Component data expectations must be clearly understood - ClientSelector expects a full client object, not just an ID
- Form reset before populating with new data helps prevent state contamination
- Debugging with console logs at input and output points helps identify object structure mismatches

---

[2025-04-15 23:30] - **Fixed Project Deletion with Enhanced Dependency Management**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Project deletion was failing with transaction errors when circular references existed:
   - Particularly when trying to delete an assessment that was converted to a job
   - `current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block` errors occurred
   - Circular references between project records prevented proper deletion

2. Implemented a comprehensive solution:
   - Added dependency checking API endpoint (`GET /projects/:id/dependencies`)
   - Improved the `deleteProject` method to handle circular references safely
   - Created a new `deleteProjectWithReferences` method for optional cascading deletion
   - Built an enhanced UI that shows deletion impact and provides options

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Backend changes:
   - Modified transaction handling in `projectService.js` to break circular references before deletion
   - Added `getProjectDependencies()` method to analyze project relationships
   - Created a helper method `_deleteProjectPhotosAndInspections()` for code reuse
   - Enhanced controller to support dependency checking and deletion options

2. Frontend changes:
   - Updated `standardized-projects.service.js` with new methods
   - Enhanced delete confirmation modal in `ProjectSettings.vue`
   - Added detailed dependency display with formatted information
   - Implemented deletion options with radio buttons

**Key Learnings:**
- Transaction management is critical when dealing with circular references
- Breaking references before deletion prevents constraint violations
- Giving users control over deletion strategy improves experience and prevents data loss
- The bidirectional nature of project references (assessment ↔ job) serves important UX needs but requires special deletion handling

[2025-04-16 02:45] - **Migrated Database from SQLite to PostgreSQL**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Successfully migrated data from SQLite to PostgreSQL using pgloader:
   - Transferred 677 communities and 13 ad_types records
   - Fixed column names with hyphens (renamed to use underscores)
   - Added created_at and updated_at timestamp columns to both tables
   - Added is_active boolean column to communities table based on state column
   - Converted date columns in ad_types from text to date type
2. Fixed column naming issue in communities table:
   - Renamed active column to is_active to match the model definition
   - Added missing indexes for name, city, and is_active columns
3. Restarted backend service to pick up the changes
4. Created database backup after migration

**Key Learnings:**
- pgloader provides a simple way to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Column names must match between database and model definitions
- Proper indexes are essential for performance
- Database migration requires careful planning and testing
- Always create backups before and after migration

---

[2025-04-16 03:30] - **Fixed Communities Page After PostgreSQL Migration**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Communities page was showing "No communities found" after SQLite to PostgreSQL migration:
   - Frontend was making API requests but not displaying any data
   - API was returning communities data correctly when tested with curl
   - Authentication was working properly for other parts of the application

2. Root causes identified:
   - Import path issue in community.service.js: incorrect path to api.service.js
   - Response data structure handling issue: frontend wasn't properly accessing the data in the API response
   - Case conversion issue: frontend expected camelCase (isActive) but backend was using snake_case (is_active)

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Fixed the import path in community.service.js:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from
   import apiClient from '@/utils/api-client';
   // To
   import apiClient from './api.service';
   ```

2. Updated the getAllCommunities method to properly handle the API response:
   ```javascript
   async getAllCommunities(filters = {}) {
     try {
       // Convert filters to snake_case for API
       const snakeCaseFilters = toSnakeCase(filters);

       // Debug the filters being sent to the API
       console.log('Fetching communities with filters:', snakeCaseFilters);

       const response = await apiClient.get('/communities', { params: snakeCaseFilters });

       // Debug the response from the API
       console.log('Communities API response:', response);

       // Ensure we're properly converting snake_case to camelCase
       const communities = toCamelCase(response.data);
       return communities;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching communities:', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restarted the frontend service to apply the changes

**Key Learnings:**
- After database migrations, carefully check for case convention mismatches between frontend and backend
- Proper debugging with console logs helps identify data structure issues
- API service imports should use relative paths for consistency
- The toCamelCase utility function is essential for handling the snake_case to camelCase conversion
- Authentication token handling is working correctly across the application

---

[2025-04-15 00:45] - **Fixed Docker Containerization and PDF Generation Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed Docker containerization issues:
   - Updated backend Dockerfile to include Chromium and dependencies for Puppeteer
   - Added environment variables to use system Chromium instead of downloading it
   - Created necessary upload directories for PDF storage
   - Fixed port configuration to ensure consistent port usage (3000 for backend, 5173 for frontend)
2. Fixed PDF generation in Docker environment:
   - Enhanced Puppeteer configuration with Docker-specific arguments
   - Improved error handling in PDF generation process
   - Changed from streaming to direct file reading for better reliability
3. Fixed data type compatibility issues:
   - Changed Payment model's paymentMethod from ENUM to STRING type with validation
   - Updated Client model's payment_terms field to use TEXT instead of STRING
4. Fixed frontend module system compatibility:
   - Updated fix-imports.js to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
   - Fixed estimate.service.js to properly re-export estimateService

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Docker environment improvements:
   - Added comprehensive dependencies in Dockerfile: `chromium`, `nss`, `freetype`, `harfbuzz`, etc.
   - Set `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true` and `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser`
   - Created all necessary upload directories with proper permissions
   - Forced backend to use port 3000 regardless of config settings
2. PDF generation enhancements:
   - Updated Puppeteer launch configuration with Docker-specific arguments
   - Added detailed logging throughout the PDF generation process
   - Improved error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Used fs.readFile instead of streaming for more reliable file delivery

**Key Learnings:**
- Puppeteer requires specific system dependencies in Alpine-based Docker containers
- Docker environment variables can be used to configure Puppeteer behavior
- Direct file reading is more reliable than streaming for PDF delivery in Docker
- Data type compatibility between Sequelize and PostgreSQL requires careful handling
- ES modules and CommonJS require different import/export patterns

---

[2025-04-14 08:30] - **Fixed Estimate Creation and PDF Generation Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed estimate creation failing with 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Updated `CreateEstimate.vue` to use standardized service approach instead of manual conversion
   - Fixed missing `sequelize` reference in `estimateService.js` that was causing server errors
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues in the backend
2. Fixed PDF generation failing with 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Enhanced error handling in `generateEstimatePDF` method with better logging
   - Added fallback for undefined estimate number when generating PDF filename
   - Improved uploads directory handling with proper error checking
   - Added detailed client address handling with better error messages

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Implemented standardized service approach for estimate creation:
   - Imported and used `standardizedEstimatesService` instead of direct API calls
   - Removed manual snake_case conversion that was causing issues
   - Added debug logging to trace data flow through the application
2. Enhanced PDF generation with robust error handling:
   - Added fallback mechanisms for missing or undefined values
   - Improved directory creation with better error handling
   - Enhanced logging throughout the PDF generation process

**Key Learnings:**
- Standardized services provide consistent data conversion and error handling
- Always check for undefined values and provide fallbacks in critical functions
- Detailed logging is essential for diagnosing complex issues
- Follow established patterns (like the invoice creation) when implementing similar features

---

[2025-04-14 07:15] - **Fixed Invoice Creation Client Validation Error**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Identified that invoice creation was failing with "Client is required" error despite having a client selected
2. Root cause: The `normalizeClient` function in `casing.js` was setting the client's `id` property but not the `clientId` property
3. The invoice creation form in `CreateInvoice.vue` was looking for `client.clientId` to set the invoice's `clientId` field
4. When validating the form, it was checking for `invoice.clientId`, which was empty, causing the validation error

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated the `normalizeClient` function to include both `id` and `clientId` properties with the same value
2. This approach ensures compatibility with components that expect either property name
3. The fix aligns with the ongoing standardization efforts in the codebase

**Key Learnings:**
- Different components in the application may use different property names for the same data
- The standardization process needs to maintain backward compatibility during the transition
- Normalization functions should support both old and new property naming patterns

---

[2025-04-14 06:30] - **Debugged and Fixed Additional Work Feature**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed incorrect middleware paths in the routes file:
   - Updated references from `../middlewares/auth.middleware` to `../middleware/auth.middleware`
   - Changed `../middlewares/uuid-validator.middleware` to `../middleware/uuidValidator`
2. Fixed model definition to use Sequelize's `Model` class pattern consistent with other models
3. Updated controller to import models directly rather than through the `db` object
4. Added proper logging to the controller for better debugging
5. Ensured correct model associations for the one-to-one relationship between estimate items and additional work

**Key Learnings:**
- Follow the established patterns in the project for middleware paths and model definitions
- Use direct model imports in controllers (`const { Model1, Model2 } = require('../models')`) for better clarity
- Add consistent logging throughout controller methods to aid in debugging
- Look at similar implementations (like the photos feature) to understand the correct patterns

---

[2025-04-14 06:15] - **Added Additional Work Tracking to Line Items**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Created a new database table `estimate_item_additional_work` to track additional work for each line item
2. Implemented backend models, controllers, and routes for the additional work functionality
3. Added a frontend service to interact with the API endpoints
4. Enhanced the EstimateItemPhotos component with an additional work checkbox and description field
5. Added a visual indicator (badge) to show when additional work has been performed on a line item

**Key Improvements:**
- Users can now document when additional work was performed beyond what was specified in the estimate
- The additional work checkbox reveals a text area for detailed descriptions when checked
- A yellow "Extra work" badge appears on line items that have additional work recorded
- The implementation follows the project's field naming conventions and error handling patterns

---

[2025-04-14 04:30] - **Project UI Restructuring: Default to Project Scope**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Made active projects default to the Line Item Photos (renamed to "Project Scope") view
2. Removed the separate Work Progress section from ProjectDetail.vue
3. Integrated receipt photo functionality into the Project Scope view with a modal upload dialog
4. Positioned the receipt upload button in the designated yellow box location
5. Removed the separate `/projects/:id/line-item-photos` route and related component
6. Created a placeholder for the legacy ProjectLineItemPhotos.vue file to maintain system integrity

**Key Improvements:**
- Streamlined project interface with a focus on the Project Scope as the primary view for active projects
- Integrated receipt functionality directly into the scope view for better workflow
- Simplified navigation by removing the need to switch between work progress and line items
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing project data and database structure

---

## What Works
- Most estimate UI bugs fixed
- Mapping for unitPrice/total is robust
- `analyzeScope` implemented in backend

## What's Left
- Syntax errors remain in `llmEstimateService.js`
- Some legacy code cleanup needed

## Next Steps
- Fix syntax errors
- Test new UI for estimates
- Confirm compatibility with legacy workflows

[2025-04-14 02:46] - **Fixed Estimate Item Photos Component Functionality**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Resolved Tailwind CSS build error (`Cannot apply unknown utility class: text-base`) in `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` by removing `@apply` from scoped styles and using direct responsive classes (`text-base sm:text-lg`).
2. Fixed frontend JavaScript error (`TypeError: estimatesService.getEstimate is not a function`) by correcting the service call to use `estimatesService.getById`.
3. Fixed backend 500 error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findAll')`) during photo fetch by ensuring `EstimateItemPhoto` model was correctly initialized in `backend/src/models/index.js`.
4. Corrected frontend error handling (`TypeError: apiAdapter.standardizeError is not a function`) and API URL (`/api/api/...`) in `standardized-estimate-item-photos.service.js`.
5. Resolved backend 404 error (`Route not found`) for photo fetching by adding the missing `GET /api/estimates/:estimateId/photos` route definition in `backend/src/routes/estimates.routes.js`.
6. Fixed backend 500 error (`Failed to get estimate`) when fetching estimate details by correcting the Sequelize `include` alias for `EstimateItem` from `estimateItems` to `items` in `backend/src/services/estimateService.js`.
7. Updated `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` to correctly access the estimate items array from the API response using the `items` key.

**Key Improvements:**
- The `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` component now correctly loads estimate data, displays line items, and allows photo management for each item.
- Resolved multiple cascading errors across frontend and backend related to this feature.

---


[2025-04-14 00:45] - **Fixed Estimate Display in Project Creation Forms**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Enhanced `EstimateSelector.vue` component to properly handle camelCase field names:
   - Updated field references (e.g., `estimate.number` → `estimate.estimateNumber`)
   - Switched to use the standardized `standardized-estimates.service.js`
   - Added better logging and debugging for estimates loading
2. Rewrote `CreateProject.vue` to use the improved `EstimateSelector` component:
   - Replaced basic dropdown with proper component showing complete estimate details
   - Added clear display of estimate number, date, amount, and status with color-coded badges
   - Simplified the code structure for better maintainability
3. Fixed bidirectional project-estimate references in database:
   - Ensured proper updating of `estimate_id` in projects table
   - Created and committed database schema backup and project/estimate data backup

**Key Improvements:**
- Users now see complete estimate information in selection UI
- Consistent visual styling with the rest of the application
- Improved project-estimate relationship management

---

[2025-04-13 23:35] - **Project Creation Workflow Refactor and Standardization**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Added `/projects/create` route as a child of `/projects` in `frontend/src/router/index.js`.
2. Created `frontend/src/views/projects/CreateProject.vue` for standardized project creation, following all memory bank best practices:
   - Uses camelCase for frontend, snake_case for backend, and field adapters for conversion.
   - Implements standardized error handling and UI feedback.
   - Fetches clients and associated estimates using standardized services.
3. Updated all "Create New Project" actions (including from settings and dashboard) to route to `/projects/create` and use the new component.
4. Removed modal-based project creation flow from `ProjectSettings.vue`.
5. "Convert to Job" workflow remains a separate, specialized flow and was not changed.

**Current Blockers / Next Steps:**
- The original issue persists: the estimate selector in the project creation form does not populate for some clients, despite valid estimates in the database. Further debugging is required.
- All architectural and workflow changes are now reflected in the memory bank for future work.
