# Progress Log

[2025-04-15 00:45] - **Fixed Docker Containerization and PDF Generation Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed Docker containerization issues:
   - Updated backend Dockerfile to include Chromium and dependencies for Puppeteer
   - Added environment variables to use system Chromium instead of downloading it
   - Created necessary upload directories for PDF storage
   - Fixed port configuration to ensure consistent port usage (3000 for backend, 5173 for frontend)
2. Fixed PDF generation in Docker environment:
   - Enhanced Puppeteer configuration with Docker-specific arguments
   - Improved error handling in PDF generation process
   - Changed from streaming to direct file reading for better reliability
3. Fixed data type compatibility issues:
   - Changed Payment model's paymentMethod from ENUM to STRING type with validation
   - Updated Client model's payment_terms field to use TEXT instead of STRING
4. Fixed frontend module system compatibility:
   - Updated fix-imports.js to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
   - Fixed estimate.service.js to properly re-export estimateService

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Docker environment improvements:
   - Added comprehensive dependencies in Dockerfile: `chromium`, `nss`, `freetype`, `harfbuzz`, etc.
   - Set `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true` and `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser`
   - Created all necessary upload directories with proper permissions
   - Forced backend to use port 3000 regardless of config settings
2. PDF generation enhancements:
   - Updated Puppeteer launch configuration with Docker-specific arguments
   - Added detailed logging throughout the PDF generation process
   - Improved error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Used fs.readFile instead of streaming for more reliable file delivery

**Key Learnings:**
- Puppeteer requires specific system dependencies in Alpine-based Docker containers
- Docker environment variables can be used to configure Puppeteer behavior
- Direct file reading is more reliable than streaming for PDF delivery in Docker
- Data type compatibility between Sequelize and PostgreSQL requires careful handling
- ES modules and CommonJS require different import/export patterns

[2025-04-14 08:30] - **Fixed Estimate Creation and PDF Generation Issues**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed estimate creation failing with 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Updated `CreateEstimate.vue` to use standardized service approach instead of manual conversion
   - Fixed missing `sequelize` reference in `estimateService.js` that was causing server errors
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues in the backend
2. Fixed PDF generation failing with 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Enhanced error handling in `generateEstimatePDF` method with better logging
   - Added fallback for undefined estimate number when generating PDF filename
   - Improved uploads directory handling with proper error checking
   - Added detailed client address handling with better error messages

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Implemented standardized service approach for estimate creation:
   - Imported and used `standardizedEstimatesService` instead of direct API calls
   - Removed manual snake_case conversion that was causing issues
   - Added debug logging to trace data flow through the application
2. Enhanced PDF generation with robust error handling:
   - Added fallback mechanisms for missing or undefined values
   - Improved directory creation with better error handling
   - Enhanced logging throughout the PDF generation process

**Key Learnings:**
- Standardized services provide consistent data conversion and error handling
- Always check for undefined values and provide fallbacks in critical functions
- Detailed logging is essential for diagnosing complex issues
- Follow established patterns (like the invoice creation) when implementing similar features

[2025-04-14 07:15] - **Fixed Invoice Creation Client Validation Error**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Identified that invoice creation was failing with "Client is required" error despite having a client selected
2. Root cause: The `normalizeClient` function in `casing.js` was setting the client's `id` property but not the `clientId` property
3. The invoice creation form in `CreateInvoice.vue` was looking for `client.clientId` to set the invoice's `clientId` field
4. When validating the form, it was checking for `invoice.clientId`, which was empty, causing the validation error

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated the `normalizeClient` function to include both `id` and `clientId` properties with the same value
2. This approach ensures compatibility with components that expect either property name
3. The fix aligns with the ongoing standardization efforts in the codebase

**Key Learnings:**
- Different components in the application may use different property names for the same data
- The standardization process needs to maintain backward compatibility during the transition
- Normalization functions should support both old and new property naming patterns

[2025-04-14 06:30] - **Debugged and Fixed Additional Work Feature**

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**
1. Fixed incorrect middleware paths in the routes file:
   - Updated references from `../middlewares/auth.middleware` to `../middleware/auth.middleware`
   - Changed `../middlewares/uuid-validator.middleware` to `../middleware/uuidValidator`
2. Fixed model definition to use Sequelize's `Model` class pattern consistent with other models
3. Updated controller to import models directly rather than through the `db` object
4. Added proper logging to the controller for better debugging
5. Ensured correct model associations for the one-to-one relationship between estimate items and additional work

**Key Learnings:**
- Follow the established patterns in the project for middleware paths and model definitions
- Use direct model imports in controllers (`const { Model1, Model2 } = require('../models')`) for better clarity
- Add consistent logging throughout controller methods to aid in debugging
- Look at similar implementations (like the photos feature) to understand the correct patterns

[2025-04-14 06:15] - **Added Additional Work Tracking to Line Items**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Created a new database table `estimate_item_additional_work` to track additional work for each line item
2. Implemented backend models, controllers, and routes for the additional work functionality
3. Added a frontend service to interact with the API endpoints
4. Enhanced the EstimateItemPhotos component with an additional work checkbox and description field
5. Added a visual indicator (badge) to show when additional work has been performed on a line item

**Key Improvements:**
- Users can now document when additional work was performed beyond what was specified in the estimate
- The additional work checkbox reveals a text area for detailed descriptions when checked
- A yellow "Extra work" badge appears on line items that have additional work recorded
- The implementation follows the project's field naming conventions and error handling patterns

[2025-04-14 04:30] - **Project UI Restructuring: Default to Project Scope**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Made active projects default to the Line Item Photos (renamed to "Project Scope") view
2. Removed the separate Work Progress section from ProjectDetail.vue
3. Integrated receipt photo functionality into the Project Scope view with a modal upload dialog
4. Positioned the receipt upload button in the designated yellow box location
5. Removed the separate `/projects/:id/line-item-photos` route and related component
6. Created a placeholder for the legacy ProjectLineItemPhotos.vue file to maintain system integrity

**Key Improvements:**
- Streamlined project interface with a focus on the Project Scope as the primary view for active projects
- Integrated receipt functionality directly into the scope view for better workflow
- Simplified navigation by removing the need to switch between work progress and line items
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing project data and database structure

[2025-04-14 02:46] - **Fixed Estimate Item Photos Component Functionality**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Resolved Tailwind CSS build error (`Cannot apply unknown utility class: text-base`) in `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` by removing `@apply` from scoped styles and using direct responsive classes (`text-base sm:text-lg`).
2. Fixed frontend JavaScript error (`TypeError: estimatesService.getEstimate is not a function`) by correcting the service call to use `estimatesService.getById`.
3. Fixed backend 500 error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findAll')`) during photo fetch by ensuring `EstimateItemPhoto` model was correctly initialized in `backend/src/models/index.js`.
4. Corrected frontend error handling (`TypeError: apiAdapter.standardizeError is not a function`) and API URL (`/api/api/...`) in `standardized-estimate-item-photos.service.js`.
5. Resolved backend 404 error (`Route not found`) for photo fetching by adding the missing `GET /api/estimates/:estimateId/photos` route definition in `backend/src/routes/estimates.routes.js`.
6. Fixed backend 500 error (`Failed to get estimate`) when fetching estimate details by correcting the Sequelize `include` alias for `EstimateItem` from `estimateItems` to `items` in `backend/src/services/estimateService.js`.
7. Updated `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` to correctly access the estimate items array from the API response using the `items` key.

**Key Improvements:**
- The `EstimateItemPhotos.vue` component now correctly loads estimate data, displays line items, and allows photo management for each item.
- Resolved multiple cascading errors across frontend and backend related to this feature.

[2025-04-14 00:45] - **Fixed Estimate Display in Project Creation Forms**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Enhanced `EstimateSelector.vue` component to properly handle camelCase field names:
   - Updated field references (e.g., `estimate.number` → `estimate.estimateNumber`)
   - Switched to use the standardized `standardized-estimates.service.js`
   - Added better logging and debugging for estimates loading
2. Rewrote `CreateProject.vue` to use the improved `EstimateSelector` component:
   - Replaced basic dropdown with proper component showing complete estimate details
   - Added clear display of estimate number, date, amount, and status with color-coded badges
   - Simplified the code structure for better maintainability
3. Fixed bidirectional project-estimate references in database:
   - Ensured proper updating of `estimate_id` in projects table
   - Created and committed database schema backup and project/estimate data backup

**Key Improvements:**
- Users now see complete estimate information in selection UI
- Consistent visual styling with the rest of the application
- Improved project-estimate relationship management

[2025-04-13 23:35] - **Project Creation Workflow Refactor and Standardization**

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Added `/projects/create` route as a child of `/projects` in `frontend/src/router/index.js`.
2. Created `frontend/src/views/projects/CreateProject.vue` for standardized project creation, following all memory bank best practices:
   - Uses camelCase for frontend, snake_case for backend, and field adapters for conversion.
   - Implements standardized error handling and UI feedback.
   - Fetches clients and associated estimates using standardized services.
3. Updated all "Create New Project" actions (including from settings and dashboard) to route to `/projects/create` and use the new component.
4. Removed modal-based project creation flow from `ProjectSettings.vue`.
5. "Convert to Job" workflow remains a separate, specialized flow and was not changed.

**Current Blockers / Next Steps:**
- The original issue persists: the estimate selector in the project creation form does not populate for some clients, despite valid estimates in the database. Further debugging is required.
- All architectural and workflow changes are now reflected in the memory bank for future work.
