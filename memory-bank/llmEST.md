# LLM Estimate Generator Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing a unified LLM-powered estimate generation system for the Construction Management Web Application. The system will combine multiple approaches for generating estimates using AI while maintaining consistency with the existing application design patterns.

## Core Requirements

1. **Unified Entry Point**: Single entry point from the "Create Estimate" dropdown menu
2. **Dual-Mode Interface**: Toggle between built-in AI and external paste interfaces
3. **Catalog Integration**: Prevent duplicate suggestions with similarity matching
4. **Assessment Context**: Utilize assessment data for more accurate suggestions
5. **Item Management**: Support for editing, pricing, and catalog saving

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning and Architecture

1. **Inventory Current Implementations**
   - Review existing code in `/frontend/src/components/estimates/LLMEstimateInput.vue`
   - Examine `/frontend/src/components/estimates/ExternalLLMInput.vue`
   - Understand integration with `/frontend/src/components/estimates/AssessmentMarkdownPanel.vue`

2. **Design Component Structure**
   - Create new unified components in `/frontend/src/components/estimates/generator/`
   - Design state management approach using Vue 3 Composition API
   - Plan API integration points with backend services

3. **Database Queries for Understanding**
   - Examine products table structure: `SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;`
   - Review estimates and estimate_items: `SELECT * FROM estimates JOIN estimate_items ON estimates.id = estimate_items.estimate_id LIMIT 5;`
   - Check assessment data structure: `SELECT * FROM project_inspections WHERE category = 'measurements' LIMIT 5;`

### Phase 2: Backend Refactoring

1. **Consolidate Backend Services**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removing Old Implementation

Before implementing the new system, carefully remove or refactor the following components:

- `/frontend/src/components/estimates/LLMEstimateInput.vue` (refactor to new pattern)
- `/frontend/src/components/estimates/ExternalLLMInput.vue` (refactor to new pattern)

Preserve the core functionality while adapting to the new architecture. Do not delete these files until the new implementation is tested and working.

### 2. Catalog Similarity Checking

The similarity checking system will require both frontend and backend components:

**Backend:**
- Add a new method in `llmEstimateService.js` called `checkCatalogSimilarity`
- Implement a scoring algorithm based on string similarity
- Return matched items with similarity scores

**Frontend:**
- Call the similarity endpoint when items are generated
- Display similarity warnings with thresholds:
  - High (>0.9): Strong warning with direct match suggestion
  - Medium (0.7-0.9): Warning with similarity note
  - Low (0.5-0.7): Suggestion only

### 3. Assessment Context Integration

To effectively use assessment context:

1. Fetch the complete assessment data including:
   - Measurements with dimensions
   - Condition reports
   - Project scope description
   - Client information

2. Format this data for LLM consumption in a structured way

3. Update the prompt templates to include:
   - Clear instructions about using the assessment data
   - Specific guidance on how to interpret measurements
   - Direction to avoid suggesting catalog items (provided in the prompt)

### 4. State Management

Use Vue 3's Composition API for state management:

1. Define shared state in the container component:
   ```
   const activeMode = ref('builtin'); // or 'external'
   const generatedItems = ref([]);
   const assessmentContext = ref(null);
   const catalogMatches = ref({});
   ```

2. Provide this state to child components

3. Implement actions as functions that modify the state:
   - `toggleMode(mode)`
   - `addGeneratedItem(item)`
   - `updateItem(id, changes)`
   - `removeItem(id)`
   - `saveToCatalog(item)`

### 5. Entry Point Integration

Modify the existing estimates interface:

1. Update the dropdown menu in the estimates list view
2. Replace the current "Use Integrated LLM Generator" and similar options
3. Add a single "AI-Powered Estimate Generation" option
4. Route this option to the new unified component

## Database Considerations

### Key Tables to Understand

1. **products**
   - Contains catalog items
   - Fields: id, name, description, price, tax_rate, unit, type

2. **estimates** and **estimate_items**
   - Store the generated estimates and line items
   - Linked through estimate_id

3. **project_inspections**
   - Contains assessment data used for context
   - Structured as category-based JSON content

4. **source_maps**
   - Links estimate items to their data sources
   - Used for bidirectional traceability

### Queries for Development

1. **Fetch Catalog Items for Similarity Checking:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, description, price, unit, type 
   FROM products 
   WHERE type = 'service' AND deleted_at IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Check Existing Estimates Structure:**
   ```sql
   SELECT e.id, e.estimate_number, e.client_id, e.project_id, 
          ei.description, ei.quantity, ei.unit_price, ei.total
   FROM estimates e
   JOIN estimate_items ei ON e.id = ei.estimate_id
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Examine Assessment Data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, project_id, category, content
   FROM project_inspections
   WHERE project_id = '<PROJECT_UUID>'
   ORDER BY category;
   ```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Database Backup:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -i management-db-1 pg_dump -U postgres management_db > /path/to/backups/management_db_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Code Backup:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Pre-deployment backup before LLM estimate generator implementation"
   git push
   ```

3. **Feature Flag Implementation:**
   Add a feature flag in the settings table to enable/disable the new system:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO settings (key, value, group) 
   VALUES ('enable_unified_llm_generator', 'false', 'estimates');
   ```

4. **Rollback Plan:**
   Document the steps to revert to the previous implementation if issues arise:
   - Revert the feature flag
   - Restore the old component routes
   - Keep old components available until full stability is confirmed

## Future Enhancements

After the initial implementation, consider these enhancements:

1. **Advanced Similarity Matching:**
   - Implement semantic similarity using embeddings
   - Consider using a vector database for more accurate matching

2. **Learning from User Choices:**
   - Track which suggestions users accept or modify
   - Use this data to improve future suggestions

3. **Multi-Model Support:**
   - Add options for different LLM models
   - Implement model selection based on estimate complexity

4. **Pricing Optimization:**
   - Use historical data to suggest optimal pricing
   - Implement price range suggestions based on project context

5. **Template Generation:**
   - Allow saving successful estimate patterns as templates
   - Implement template-based generation for common project types

## Conclusion

This implementation guide provides a structured approach to building a unified LLM-powered estimate generation system. By following these steps, you'll create a flexible, maintainable system that integrates seamlessly with the existing application while providing enhanced functionality for generating accurate construction estimates.

The iterative approach allows for testing and refinement at each stage, ensuring a stable and user-friendly final product. Focus on maintaining consistent UX patterns and thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition for users.
